Client work for foundersuite. Visit my personal site for [screenshots](http://hao-liu.com/#foundersuite)

<p class="left">I was hired by <a href="http://foundersuite.com/" target="_blank"><b>Foundersuite</b></a> to build the entire front-end of their new web application in <b>Backbone</b>. My proposed mockup for the summary view was accepted and implemented. I also set up custom routes and wrote helper methods in the <b>Rails</b> server. The app is releasing soon. I'm not allowed to share live demos or feature descriptions during <u><b>stealth development</b></u>, therefore <u>comparison to their released app and blurred screenshots</u> are included.</p>
